          Here's a quick overview about me.
        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I am a skilled Full Stack Developer with a passion for creating
          dynamic and user-friendly web applications. With a background in
          hospitality, management, and recruitment, I've spent the last few
          years honing in on my people skills and developed a strong foundation
          in team collaboration, project management, and problem-solving. I
          specialize in React, Node.js and Ruby on Rails and have a growing
          expertise in TypeScript and Next.js. I thrive under tight deadlines
          and enjoy continuously learning and adapting to overcome challenges.
          Outside of tech, I'm an avid fan of outdoor activities, particularly
          skiing, and I'm always eager to connect with others who share my
          enthusiasm for innovation and the great outdoors.
